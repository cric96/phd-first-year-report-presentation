  \begin{cardTiny}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Typically applied in \textit{collective} systems
      \item Can be used both at \textit{architectural} and \textit{paradigm} level
      \item [\failure{\faThumbsDown}] Lack of stronge proof as single agent context
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{card}[First year: Algorithms improvement \href{here}{\faLink}]
    \begin{itemize}  
      \item Indipendent Q-Learning combined with Aggregate Computing
      \item Agents learn to reach a stable configuration faster then standard approach
      \item[\failure{\faThumbsDown}] hard reward function definition, possible large action/state
    \end{itemize}
