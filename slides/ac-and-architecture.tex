\begin{frame}{Aggregate Computing infrastructure}
  \begin{card}[Deployment]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Behavioural specification should be seperated from underlying network
      \item Pulverisation~\cite{scafiloci} goes toward this direction
      \item We concretize Pulverisede architecture combining ScaFi with Multi-tier programming -- ScalaLoci
    \end{itemize}
  \end{card}

  \begin{card}[Control and Monitoring]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We leverage simulation to verify program correctness
      \item Novel work \cite{} use Aggregate Computing itself to monitor distrubted properties at runtime
      \item Currently, no tools support this works, ScaFi-Web goes towards this directions.
    \end{itemize}
