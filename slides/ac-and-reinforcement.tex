  \begin{cardTiny}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Typically applied in \textit{collective} systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/icse/DAngeloGGGNPT19}
      \item Reinforcement Learning can be used both at \textit{architectural} and \textit{paradigm} level
      \item [\failure{\faThumbsDown}] Lack of strong proofs as single agent context
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}  
      \item Indipendent Q-Learning~\cite{watkins1992q} combined with Aggregate Computing
      \item Agents learn to reach a stable configuration faster than the standard approach
      \item[\failure{\faThumbsDown}] Challenging reward function definition, possible large action/state, unstable learning
    \end{itemize}
